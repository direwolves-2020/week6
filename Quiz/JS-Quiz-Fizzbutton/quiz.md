## Phase 2, Week 2 Quiz: FizzButton Quiz

* Create an HTML page. It should have a title of "Fizzbuzz" and a visible
heading that also says "Fizzbuzz."

* Create a button with the label "Buzz!"

* When the button is clicked, add HTML to the document (such as the contents
of a div, elements in a list, etc. That shows the numbers 1 to 100 except where
the number is divisible by 3, the word "Fizz" is shown instead, where the
number is divisible by 5, the word "Buzz" is shown, and where the number is
divisible by 3 and by 5, the word "FizzBuzz" is shown instead.

* Use css to change the appearance of the text or page layout. (Non default
color or font, two column layout with the button on the left, etc. This part
is open-ended.)
