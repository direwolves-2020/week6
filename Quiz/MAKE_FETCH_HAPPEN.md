## Javascript Quiz:

### Bonus/Elective
You should use the fetch api call for this which will require you to work with promises. It is an elective, but I'd recommend you at least take a shot at it.

### Stock lookup

Write a javascript program and HTML file with a title, a text input field,
a button, and a div to contain output.

Change the appearance of at least 2 of the elements using a stylesheet.

The user inputs a stock symbol and then the price of that stock is displayed
in the contents of an html div.

Use the markit on demand API

with the input symbol replacing aapl
